					<p> As a member of UC Berkeley's human-centered design group, Berkeley Innovation, I had the opportunity to work with design consulting firm, Vertigo Software, Inc., to create a modern second-screen tablet application. A growing trend of users using "second-screens" (mobile devices, laptops, tablets, etc.) while viewing entertainment media presented us with an opportunity to create a product that would bridge this gap. Throughout our process, we focused on user research, multiple iterations of wireframes and prototypes, and concept generation. These are the steps my team and I took to achieve our goal <a href="#binderfinal">(or view the design now).</a></p>

			 			<h3> User Research</h3>
			 			<p> We interviewed around 20 people, drawing from a list of questions that we created to understand people's behaviors when they watch media, and also observed users while they watched television.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col span_2_of_6">
						<h3> Primary User Needs</h3>
 						<p> From our user research, we summarized our research findings as follows: 
 						<ul>
			 				<li> Enhance, not distract the viewing experience </li>
			 				<li> Incentivize live viewing </li>
			 				<li> Present extra information not provided by the program</li> 
 						</ul>
 						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col span_2_of_6">
			 			<h3> Defining the Problem</h3>
			 			<p>We narrowed our problem to two "how might we" questions: How might we enhance the user's viewing experience without distraction from the main screen? How might we make media entertainment more interactive?</p>

						<p>We wanted to develop something that had more educational value, instead of a social-media centered entertainment media app. During our user research, we noticed that when people were watching educational programs, they often had to do further research to fully understand a concept. We wanted to help bridge this gap in information by creating a tablet application that would give viewers easy and instant access to relevant information that would automatically be generated based on the media they were watching or listening to.</p>

					<h2> Finding a New Opportunity and Transforming the Concept</h2>

				<div class="section group">
					<div class="col span_3_of_6">
						<p>After a few rounds of creating wireframes, we mapped out and developed interaction pathways for the application. We also tested these wireframes and sought feedback for them. In doing so, we learned from users that being able to create, generate, and save content related to a concept would be most beneficial during live, in-person events (like lectures and conferences). As a team, we decided to then shift our design from content generation for educational entertainment media, to content generation and note-taking for in-person educational events.</p>

					<h2> Final Design Choices</h2>

				<div class="section group">
					<div class="col span_3_of_6">
	 					<p> We made several choices about the features our app should have and its design based on how it would benefit the user. Here are a few examples:</p>
	 					<ol> 
	 						<li> <b>Limit main interactions to four easily visible and accessible action buttons: take a snapshot, record a clip, write a note, and grab a slide.</b> It's important to not distract the user from the event they are watching and ensure they do not waste time.	</li>
	 						<li> <b>Allow users to see a live user engagement tracker and view other users' content.</b> Users want to know what others think and should be able to add relevant and novel information from others users' pages to his or her own.</li>
	 						<li> <b>Content-creation action page and saved user-generated content are separated. </b>This issue was met with conflict within the team, but was resolved when we received user feedback: while watching an event, the user was focused on <em>creating content</em> as opposed to reviewing saved content-- thereby making it unnecessary to see saved content at all times. However, it would still be accessible without forsaking clean UI.</li>
	 						<li> <b> All saved content will have a timestamp.</b> It's extremely useful to return to your notes and see a linear train of thought. In this case, it's also helpful to reference the video and pair your thoughts at the exact time.</li>

	 						</ol>
