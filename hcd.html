					<p>I participated in a group project for a class hosted by IDEO and +Acumen, called<a href="http://plusacumen.org/courses/hcd-for-social-innovation/">Human-Centered Design for Social Innovation.</a> The course taught me in greater detail the process and methods of human-centered design to create solutions for difficult challenges. I came away with a stronger ability to conduct user research, need-finding, brainstorming, and concept-generation.</p>

						<h3>How do we increase social entrepreneurship among young people? </h3>
						<p>Many students have brilliant ideas, but have no idea where to start. Top-tier universities typically show higher rates of entrepreneurship, where there is an abundance of resources and expertise. Elsewhere, entrepreneurship can seem like something not everyone can do-- especially early on-- and we wanted to help students determine the necessary steps in pursuing a social entrepreneurship goal.</p>

				<div class="section group">
					<div class="col span_2_of_6">
			 			<h3> User Research </h3>
			 			<p> We conducted many interviews with students and "experts." The "experts" for our purposes was anyone who was currently an entrepreneur or very knowledgable about start-ups. This included asking Dustin Moskovitz several questions during a Q&A session held at UC Berkeley.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col span_2_of_6">
						<h3> Contextual Research</h3>
 						<p> We also decided it would be important to immerse ourselves in the context by visiting a local start-up incubator, called Skydeck. We also interviewed another start-up incubator, called The Foundry@Citrus for a deeper look into the process of transforming an idea into a company.
 						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col span_2_of_6">
			 			<h3> Analagous Research</h3>
			 			<p>This was important in order to see other situations in which goal-making, leadership, and entreprenurship are fostered. This included an entirely student-run volunteer organization called the Suitcase Clinic and local community colleges to see how they are tackling the issue.</p>

						<h3> Key Findings</h3>
						<p> We organized our major research findings by theme, in order to find the three most pressing concerns. Our major categories included: experts + mentors, validation, outreach + resources, culture, passion, self awareness + connections, measurable goals + successes. From here, we decided to focus on three themes that we thought were the biggest challenges young people need help with to overcome: </p>

							<li>Web platform that with a Reddit-like and Piazza-like discussion forum for feedback (scoring based)</li>

					<h2> Choosing the Features</h2>

				<div class="section group">

	 					<p> We discussed the pros and cons of each idea and chose which one we liked best. Ultimately, we chose to move forward with creating a website with the following features:</p>
	 					<ol> 
	 						<li>Users will create profiles with their skills and be able to search for other people based on desired skills.</li>
	 						<li> Users can post their start-up ideas which users can "upvote," as well as comment on.</li>
	 						<li> Users can request mentorship from "mentors" that are brought onto the site.</li>

					<p> Our final concept was to create a webpage that included these major features, allowing minimal risk for students in validating their ideas and finding a mentor that would guide their entrepreneurship goals. For each major interaction, we created a concept page that could be built upon for actual prototyping.<br><br></p>
